# Project Intent

The purpose for this analysis is to provide an in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing the end user to filter for multiple criteria independent of each other.  This works by adding table filters for the DATE, CITY, STATE, COUNTRY, and SHAPE of the UFO itself.

While using the webpage is an elementary task, and first glance, the data can be quite daunting.  The

## Filter Through the Table ##

All filters are deemed function by this illustration and still reporting data.

Below, I used the criteria DATE = '1/1/20100, City = 'la mesa', state = 'ca', COuntry = 'us', and UFO shape = 'triangle'.
One row of data was returned.

This is important to show the ALL filters applied are showing accurate data, and all filters are IN FORCE doing what they are supposed to.

# Summary #

While the filters do make for a user experience of convenience, the backend work needed for this to keep a refreshed data governance may be a concern for someone more technical and less aesthetic.  In theory, this makes for a great options, alternative to an excel spreadsheet, and would make for more transparency across multiple teams.  I can see using this for static tables, such a manufacturing plants/sites, flat rate modes of transportation, and multiple other QUALITATIVE values that rarely would change.   In many industries, those instances are few and far between.  However, they do exist and this HTML/CSS holds merit.
